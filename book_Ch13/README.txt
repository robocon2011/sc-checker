exercise 13.2 -> pcix - problems with "const char" vs. "string" in sc_fifo, incompatibility between SystemC2.2.0 and gcc 4.2.1?
exercise 13.3 -> heartbeat, oontains deprecated code 
exercise 13.4 -> adapt - needs "is_reset()" implemented because inherited from sc_signal
exercise 13.5 -> hier_chan - significant SystemC Warnings about 4 valued logic, is this correct?
